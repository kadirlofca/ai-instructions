# General Instructions for AI in Software Development

1. **Understand before acting** - Read and analyze all relevant code, documentation, and context before making changes.

2. **Make minimal changes** - Modify only what's necessary to solve the problem; avoid refactoring unrelated code.

3. **Test thoroughly** - Run existing tests, add new tests for changes, and verify everything works before completing.

4. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase's style, conventions, and architecture rather than imposing new patterns.

5. **Communicate clearly** - Explain your changes, reasoning, and any trade-offs or limitations encountered.

6. **Handle errors gracefully** - Always consider edge cases, validation, and error handling in your implementations.

7. **Prioritize security** - Never introduce vulnerabilities; validate inputs, protect sensitive data, and follow security best practices.
